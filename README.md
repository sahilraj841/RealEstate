# Real Estate Clone Project

## Overview
This project is a real estate clone built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) with advanced authentication features. It includes implementation of JWT (JSON Web Tokens), Firebase, and Google OAuth for secure user authentication and authorization. The project focuses on providing a seamless user experience with user-friendly features such as image uploads for property listings and intuitive property listing management.

## Features
- **Advanced Authentication**: Secure user login and registration with JWT authentication.
- **Firebase Integration**: Additional authentication options and enhanced security with Firebase authentication.
- **Google OAuth**: Seamless login using Google accounts for a familiar user experience.
- **User-Friendly Features**: Intuitive features such as image uploads for property listings and easy property listing management.
- **Secure and Seamless Access**: Robust security and seamless access to the application for users.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
